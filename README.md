Hi everyone,
I decided to let this project public, even the files which gives access to my local db, since there's nothing on it.
I'm currently working on creating a functioning chess game program just like the ones currently existing (chess.com, Lichess).
I thought it would be a great oppurtunity and a great way of learning HTML CSS JS/Jquery and PHP AJAX. 
The ultimate goal is to experiment some ML and AI on it, but first i need tofinish the program. 
I created this page on 29/01/2024 and i hope to update this repository every 10 days.
